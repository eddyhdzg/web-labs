              <p>
                Currently I work mostly designing a PWA (Progressive Web App), a
                super app which has several functionalities like chat, feed,
                news, events and more for my university. I work with doing
                concept testing, Design Sprint and Lean Startup methodologies to
                design what our users want as a service. <br /><br />

                For UX design I draw low level wireframes mostly on a
                whiteboard, then we design high level wireframes in Sketch,
                prototyping is mostly made in InVision within my team.
                <br /><br />

                As the only developer on the UX team I take advantage of having
                a different point of view, knowing and understanding the
                technologies.

                I landed my first job with a company as a UX Designer, I
                prototyped in Adobe XD and developed all by my self an admin
                dashboard which let you select several images and call an
                external API which generated a video. <br /><br />
                I used React with create react app, JSS, Context API, Firebase
                authentication, storage and database.

                I developed several APIs of an application using Django and
                mysql and then designed the front end for each with Angular5 and
                Bootstrap and finally integrate the front with the backend. This
                was my first real encounter with a development team, I learned
                to work with agile methodologies.

                rules, firebase storage and more. <br /><br />

                data, send massive emails and define projects.
